# Trek Destiny
Trek Destiny is a Go-based microservice application designed to connect travelers with local hosts. Travelers can post trip requests, while hosts can respond with accommodation offers. The platform emphasizes affordability, cultural exchange, and community-driven travel experiences. By leveraging a microservice architecture, Trek Destiny ensures scalability, flexibility, and a clear separation of concerns between different services such as authentication, trip management, communication, and reviews.

## Features

**Traveler Trip Requests:** Travelers can create and share trip details, making it easy for hosts to see when and where they need accommodation.

**Host Offers:** Local hosts can post available spaces, accept or decline traveler requests, and manage their hosting history.

**User Profiles:** Both travelers and hosts have customizable profiles including personal details, trip history, and cultural preferences.

**Messaging System:** Built-in communication channel for travelers and hosts to coordinate plans before confirming stays.

**Reviews & Ratings:** After each completed trip, both travelers and hosts can leave feedback to build trust in the community.

**Microservice Architecture:** Each core function (authentication, trip handling, messaging, reviews) is managed as a separate Go-based microservice, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

**Cultural Exchange Focus:** Beyond accommodations, the platform is designed to encourage interaction between travelers and locals, fostering authentic travel experiences.
